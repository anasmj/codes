WidgetsBindingObserver is a mixin in Flutter that allows you to listen to and respond to various application lifecycle changes and UI events. It is particularly useful for monitoring changes in the app's state, such as when it is paused, resumed, inactive, or detached.

* listen to events when the app moves between different states..
* Track system events such as screen rotation (orientation changes) or when the system is running low on memory.
* Handle tasks when the app enters the background and returns to the foreground

Common Methods in WidgetsBindingObserver:
```
didChangeAppLifecycleState(AppLifecycleState state)
```
* inactive: App is in an inactive state, but not yet paused.
* paused: App is not currently visible to the user, but still running in the background.
* resumed: App is visible and interacting with the user.
* detached: App is completely detached from the host operating system.

Example: 

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class MyAppState extends State<MyApp> with WidgetsBindingObserver {
  
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Register the observer
    WidgetsBinding.instance.addObserver(this);
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    // Unregister the observer
    WidgetsBinding.instance.removeObserver(this);
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  void didChangeAppLifecycleState(AppLifecycleState state) {
    super.didChangeAppLifecycleState(state);
    if (state == AppLifecycleState.paused) {
      // App is in background
      print('App is paused');
    } else if (state == AppLifecycleState.resumed) {
      // App is in foreground
      print('App is resumed');
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('WidgetsBindingObserver Example')),
      body: Center(child: Text('Monitor App Lifecycle')),
    );
  }
}
```
